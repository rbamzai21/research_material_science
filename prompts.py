PROBLEM_DESCRIPTION = """
Design a 1-dimensional descriptor for predicting whether ABX3 materials form stable perovskite structures.

The attached figure shows:
(A) The cubic ABX3 perovskite structure — the A cation sits inside a cage of corner-sharing BX6 octahedra. Stability depends on how well the A cation fits this cage, which is controlled by the relative sizes of A, B, and X ions.
(B) A periodic table map of all elements that appear at the A, B, or X sites in the experimentally characterized ABX3 compounds.

Available inputs (all floats):
- rA: Shannon ionic radius of the A-site cation (12-fold coordination)
- rB: Shannon ionic radius of the B-site cation (6-fold coordination)
- rX: Shannon ionic radius of the X-site anion (6-fold coordination)
- nA: oxidation state of A (positive integer)
- nB: oxidation state of B (positive integer)
- nX: oxidation state of X (negative integer)

Physical context:
- The classical Goldschmidt tolerance factor is t = (rA + rX) / (sqrt(2) * (rB + rX))

Requirements:
- The function must be named `descriptor` with signature: def descriptor(rA, rB, rX, nA, nB, nX)
- Return a single finite float value (1-dimensional descriptor)
- The descriptor should be monotonic with respect to stability (either higher = more stable or lower = more stable)

Output format — a JSON object with three keys:
```json
{
  "function": "def descriptor(rA, rB, rX, nA, nB, nX):\\n    ...",
  "explanation": "Brief explanation of the physical reasoning behind this descriptor.",

The attached histogram shows the descriptor value distribution for perovskites (blue) vs nonperovskites (orange), with the decision boundary (dashed line). The green region is predicted perovskite, red is predicted nonperovskite.

Analyze what the previous descriptor gets wrong:
- Look at the overlap between perovskite and nonperovskite distributions
- Consider which anion types (O, F, Cl, Br, I) have low accuracy
- Think about what physical effects are missing

Propose an IMPROVED descriptor that addresses these weaknesses. Make a meaningful change to the functional form, not just parameter tweaking.

DEBUG_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
The following Python descriptor function crashed when executed on the dataset:

```python
{code}
```

Error message:
```
{error}
```

Fix the function so it handles all valid inputs without errors.
Constraints:
- The function must be named `descriptor`
- Signature: def descriptor(rA, rB, rX, nA, nB, nX)
- rA, rB, rX are positive floats (ionic radii in Angstroms)
- nA, nB are positive integers (oxidation states)
- nX is a negative integer (oxidation state)
- rA > rB is guaranteed
- Must return a single finite float

Output ONLY the fixed Python function, no explanation.
