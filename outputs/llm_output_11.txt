Your `colvars.conf` and LAMMPS input snippet look mostly correct for defining the collective variables (CVs) you want. Here are a few notes and suggestions to ensure everything works smoothly:

### 1. `colvars.conf` notes:

- **Atom groups**: You define atom groups by explicit atom IDs, which is fine for small systems or fixed atom sets.
- **Distance CVs**: The `distance` block computes average distances between pairs of atoms in two groups within a cutoff.
- **Angle CV**: The `angle` block computes angles formed by triplets of atoms from the specified groups.
- **Multiple distance blocks in one CV**: The `tolerance_factor_proxy` CV has two `distance` blocks. The colvars module does not support combining multiple distance blocks inside a single `colvar` block to produce a combined scalar value. Instead, it will treat the second `distance` block as overriding the first or cause an error.

### Suggested fix for `tolerance_factor_proxy`:

Since you want to output both distances separately for post-processing, define two separate colvars instead of combining them:

```tcl
colvar {
  name a_x_distance
  distance {
    group1 { atomGroup a_atoms }
    group2 { atomGroup x_atoms }
    cutoff 4.0
  }
  outputAppliedForce on
}

colvar {
  name b_x_distance
  distance {
    group1 { atomGroup b_atoms }
    group2 { atomGroup x_atoms }
    cutoff 3.0
  }
  outputAppliedForce on
}
```

Then you can compute the ratio (tolerance factor proxy) externally from the two outputs.

### 2. Full revised `colvars.conf` example:

```tcl
colvarsTrajFrequency 1000
colvarsRestartFrequency 10000

atomGroup {
  name b_atoms
  atoms 101 102 103 104
}
atomGroup {
  name x_atoms
  atoms 201 202 203 204 205 206
}
atomGroup {
  name a_atoms
  atoms 1 2 3 4
}

colvar {
  name avg_bx_bond_length
  distance {
    group1 { atomGroup b_atoms }
    group2 { atomGroup x_atoms }
    cutoff 3.0
  }
  outputAppliedForce on
}

colvar {
  name octahedral_tilt
  angle {
    group1 { atomGroup x_atoms }
    group2 { atomGroup b_atoms }
    group3 { atomGroup x_atoms }
  }
  outputAppliedForce on
}

colvar {
  name a_x_distance
  distance {
    group1 { atomGroup a_atoms }
    group2 { atomGroup x_atoms }
    cutoff 4.0
  }
  outputAppliedForce on
}

colvar {
  name b_x_distance
  distance {
    group1 { atomGroup b_atoms }
    group2 { atomGroup x_atoms }
    cutoff 3.0
  }
  outputAppliedForce on
}
```

### 3. LAMMPS input file snippet:

Your LAMMPS input is fine. Just make sure the `colvars` package is installed and enabled in your LAMMPS build.

```lammps
units real
atom_style full

read_data system.data

fix mycv all colvars outputs/colvars.conf

# Add your integrator, thermostat, timestep, etc.
```

---

### Summary

- Split the combined `tolerance_factor_proxy` into two separate colvars.
- Keep your atom groups and other CVs as is.
- Use post-processing to compute the ratio from the two distance outputs.

If you want, I can help you write a post-processing script to compute the tolerance factor proxy from the output files. Let me know!
