Your `colvars.conf` and `in.lammps` files look mostly correct for defining and using collective variables (colvars) in LAMMPS. Here are a few notes and suggestions to ensure smooth operation:

1. **colvars.conf:**
   - The syntax is consistent with the Colvars module.
   - You define three colvars: `tolerance_factor` (a distance), `octahedral_tilt` (an angle), and `oxidation_state_balance` (a distance).
   - The atom numbers are specified correctly.
   - Boundaries and widths are set.

2. **in.lammps:**
   - You load the colvars fix with the correct syntax.
   - Make sure the path `outputs/colvars.conf` is correct relative to where you run LAMMPS.
   - You might want to add `fix mycv all colvars outputs/colvars.conf` **before** any run commands.
   - You may want to add `thermo_style custom` to output colvars values if desired.

### Example minimal additions to `in.lammps`:

```lammps
units real
atom_style full
read_data system.data

fix mycv all colvars outputs/colvars.conf

thermo 100
thermo_style custom step temp pe etotal f_mycv[1] f_mycv[2] f_mycv[3]

run 10000
```

- `f_mycv[1]` corresponds to the first colvar (`tolerance_factor`), `f_mycv[2]` to the second (`octahedral_tilt`), etc.
- Adjust `thermo` frequency and run length as needed.
