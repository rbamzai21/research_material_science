Your `colvars.conf` and LAMMPS input script look well structured for defining collective variables (colvars) and integrating them into a LAMMPS simulation using the colvars module.

Here are a few notes and suggestions to ensure everything works smoothly:

1. **Colvars Module in LAMMPS**:  
   Ensure your LAMMPS build includes the colvars package. You can check this by running `lmp -h` and looking for `colvars` in the list of packages. If not present, you need to build LAMMPS with the colvars package enabled.

2. **File Paths**:  
   The `fix mycv all colvars outputs/colvars.conf` command assumes the `outputs` directory exists and contains `colvars.conf`. Make sure the path is correct relative to where you run LAMMPS. If `colvars.conf` is in the same directory as `in.lammps`, you can just write:
   ```
   fix mycv all colvars colvars.conf
   ```
   or create the `outputs` folder and place the file there.

3. **Colvars Configuration Syntax**:  
   The syntax you used looks like a hybrid between the colvars module format and a custom format. The official colvars module typically uses a different syntax, for example:

   ```tcl
   colvar {
     name tolerance_factor
     width 0.1
     lowerBoundary 0.7
     upperBoundary 1.2
     distance {
       group1 { atomNumbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 }
       group2 { atomNumbers 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 }
     }
   }
   ```

   But since your format is consistent and presumably supported by your setup, just confirm that your colvars module version supports `atomGroup` and `customFunction` blocks as you wrote.

4. **Custom Function and Properties**:  
   The `customFunction` with `property oxidation_state` requires that the colvars module or your simulation environment supports per-atom properties like `oxidation_state`. Make sure this property is defined in your data or through some other means (e.g., via atom attributes or a plugin).

5. **Example Minimal Working Input**:

   Here's an example minimal `in.lammps` snippet assuming your files are in the same directory:

   ```lammps
   units real
   atom_style full
   read_data system.data

   # Load colvars fix with your configuration file
   fix mycv all colvars colvars.conf

   # Run for 1000 steps (example)
   run 1000
   ```

6. **Output and Debugging**:  
   The colvars fix will output collective variable values to a file (usually `colvars.traj` or similar). Check this file to verify that the colvars are computed as expected.

If you want, I can help you convert your `colvars.conf` into the official colvars module syntax or help write a more complete LAMMPS input script. Just let me know!
