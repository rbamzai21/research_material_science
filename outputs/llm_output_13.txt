Your `colvars.conf` and LAMMPS input snippet look mostly correct for integrating colvars with LAMMPS. Here are some suggestions and clarifications:

1. **colvars.conf:**
   - The `distance` colvar `tolerance_factor` is defined between two groups of atoms (1-9 and 10-18). This will compute the distance between the centers of these two groups.
   - The `angle` colvar `octahedral_tilt` uses three atom groups, which is valid for defining an angle between groups.
   - The `custom` colvar `oxidation_state_balance` uses a placeholder script. You will need to replace the script content with actual TCL code to compute the oxidation state difference.

2. **LAMMPS input (`in.lammps`):**
   - The `fix mycv all colvars outputs/colvars.conf` line correctly attaches the colvars module and points to your colvars configuration file.
   - Make sure the `outputs/colvars.conf` path is correct relative to your LAMMPS working directory.
   - You may want to add `thermo_style custom` or output commands to monitor the colvars during the run.

### Example: Minimal additions to your LAMMPS input for output

```lammps
units real
atom_style full
read_data system.data

fix mycv all colvars outputs/colvars.conf

thermo 100
thermo_style custom step temp f_mycv[1] f_mycv[2] f_mycv[3]

run 10000
```

- Here `f_mycv[1]`, `f_mycv[2]`, `f_mycv[3]` correspond to the three colvars defined, assuming colvars fix exposes them as fix outputs.
- Adjust `thermo` frequency and `run` length as needed.

### Notes on the custom colvar script

The `custom` colvar with a TCL script requires the colvars module to be compiled with TCL support. The script block is evaluated every timestep. You can access atom properties or other variables via TCL commands.

Example placeholder to return a computed value (replace with your logic):

```tcl
script {
  # Example: compute difference between sum of oxidation states of group A and B
  set oxA 0.0
  set oxB 0.0
  # loop over atoms in group A and B (define groups in colvars or pass as variables)
  # accumulate oxidation states (user must define how to get these)
  return [expr {$oxA - $oxB}]
}
```
