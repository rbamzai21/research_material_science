  "cv_name": "Charge-Weighted Octahedral Size Mismatch Index",
  "physical_quantity": "Measures the combined effect of ionic size mismatch and charge imbalance between A-site and B-site cations relative to the anion size, reflecting geometric and electrostatic compatibility",
  "information_required": [
    "ionic radii (rA, rB, rB\u2032, rX)",
    "oxidation states (nA, nB, nB\u2032, nX)"
  ],
  "why_it_matters": "Stability of perovskites depends on how well the sizes and charges of A, B, and B\u2032 cations fit around the anion framework without causing excessive distortion; this CV captures both size and charge mismatch in a single scalar that generalizes across oxides and halides",
  "definition": "CV = | (nA * rA) - 0.5 * (nB * rB + nB\u2032 * rB\u2032) | / rX"
