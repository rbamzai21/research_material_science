System: Predicting stability of inorganic perovskite materials (ABX₃ and A₂BB′X₆)

Molecule description:
- Perovskite oxides and halides of the form ABX₃
    - A, B are cations of varying radii and oxidation states
    - X is an anion: O²⁻, F⁻, Cl⁻, Br⁻, or I⁻
- Also extended to double perovskites A₂BB′X₆

Structural stability determined by ionic radii, oxidation states, and geometric constraints involving BX₆ octahedra

Simulation goal:
- Can we develop a single, accurate, physically interpretable 1-dimensional tolerance factor that reliably predicts whether a given ABX₃ or A₂BB′X₆ compound will form a stable perovskite structure?
- Specifically:
    - Improve upon the classical Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t), which is inaccurate for many halides
    - Use SISSO (Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator) to derive an optimal formula
    - Produce a descriptor that is:
        - Accurate across oxides and halides
        - Monotonic and capable of yielding a probability of perovskite formation
        - Based only on composition (ionic radii and oxidation states)
    - Apply the new tolerance factor (τ) to:
        - Validate performance on 576 known compounds
        - Generalize to 1034 additional single/double perovskites
        - Predict over 23,000 previously unexplored double perovskites likely to be stable
