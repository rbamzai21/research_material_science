System: Predicting stability of inorganic perovskite materials (ABX₃ and A₂BB′X₆)

You are designing candidate 1-dimensional, composition-based descriptors for predicting whether a material forms a stable perovskite structure. 

Material class:
- Perovskite oxides and halides of the form ABX₃
- Double perovskites A₂BB′X₆
- A, B, B′ are cations with known ionic radii and oxidation states
- X is an anion: O²⁻, F⁻, Cl⁻, Br⁻, or I⁻

Physical basis: 
- Stability depends on geometric compatibility of BX₆ octahedra
- Size mismatch, charge balance, and coordination constraints control distortions
- Only composition-based quantities may be used:
    - ionic radii (rA, rB, rB′, rX)
    - oxidation states (nA, nB, nB′, nX)

Descriptor requirements:
- Produce a single scalar value (1D)
- Must be physically interpretable
- Must be monotonic with respect to stability
- Must be computable from composition alone
- Must generalize across oxides and halides

Exploration guidance:
- Do not restrict descriptors to simple ratios of ionic radii
- Explore a broad range of functional forms, including:
    - sums and differences of radii
    - ratios and products
    - nonlinear functions (logarithms, powers, exponentials)
    - coupling between size and oxidation state (e.g., nA·rA, rB/nB)
    - asymmetry or mismatch measures (e.g., |rA − rB|, (rA − rB)²)
- Goldschmidt-like ratios may appear, but alternative mathematical structures should also be considered

Goal: Generate novel candidate tolerance-factor–like descriptors that
- improve predictive power over classical Goldschmidt t
- perform consistently across oxides and halides
- can be tested by regression or classification on known stability data
- are suitable for high-throughput screening of large composition spaces
