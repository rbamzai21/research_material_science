System: A small peptide in water box

Molecule description:
- A tripeptide Gly-Ala-Ser
- Solvated in a cubic box of TIP3P water (approx. 500 molecules)
- Neutralized with Na+ counterions

Simulation goal:
- Study backbone dihedral transitions of the peptide
- Monitor radius of gyration
- Observe hydrogen bonding between peptide and solvent
